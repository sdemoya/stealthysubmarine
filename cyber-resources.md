## CVEs - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Format: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER

### ExploitDB - https://www.exploit-db.com/
very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest

Kali comes pre-installed with a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!



### NVD - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
good place to look if you're researching vulnerabilities in a specific piece of software

### CVE Mitre - https://cve.mitre.org/
